This repo is functionality complete â€” PRs and issues welcome!
Additionally, there is an Angular 1.5 version of this codebase that you can [fork](https://github.com/PuneethReddyHC/articles-management-app/) and/or [learn how to recreate](https://thinkster.io/angularjs-es6-tutorial).


# How it works

We're currently working on some docs for the codebase (explaining where functionality is located, how it works, etc) but the codebase should be straightforward to follow as is. We've also released a [step-by-step tutorial w/ screencasts](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/building-real-world-angular-2-apps) that teaches you how to recreate the codebase from scratch.

### Making requests to the backend API

If you want to change the API URL to a local server, simply edit `src/environments/environment.ts` and change `api_url` to the local server's URL (i.e. `localhost:3000/api`)


# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from [Here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), then run `yarn install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).
